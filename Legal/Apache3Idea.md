# Problem: 
The current OSS licensing regime is at odds with the future technology landscape, where OSS systems are used in material or critical Agent systems.

# Solution:
Priority Zero Patch Install to Existing Licensing Regime by:

- Adding a limited warranty for models
- Self-Disclosure of license compliance
- Self-regulated validation through assessment (open-source integrity)


# MVP
Notwithstanding the "Disclaimer of Warranty" in Section 7, the Licensor provides a limited implied warranty that the Work, 
when used as intended under regular use, will perform substantially as described in the official documentation 
for a period of [specific time, milestone]. 

This limited warranty does not cover issues caused by 
modifications, misuse, or external factors.

This warranty gives you specific legal rights, 
and you may also have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
